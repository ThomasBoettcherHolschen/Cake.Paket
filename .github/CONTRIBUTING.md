# Getting Started

Assuming you have a GitHub account and have forked the repository, you'll need to run `.\.paket\paket.exe restore` to get all the dependencies. Checkout out [paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/) for more details. Optionally, if you want to setup a build on AppVeyor, Travis CI, or locally, then run `.\build.ps1` in PowerShell or `./build.sh` in bash. Please see the *build.ps1* and/or *build.sh* scripts for more detail.
